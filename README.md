# Acornsoft Lisp v4.06

The Acornsoft Lisp ROM binary (from 1983), disassembled / reassembled by TobyLobster in 2023

Made by disassembling the original [LISP406 binary](https://mdfs.net/System/ROMs/Language/LISP/) with [py8dis](https://github.com/ZornsLemma/py8dis) then adding original label names and comments.
